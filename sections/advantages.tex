{\bf Upgrade Poupart method for encoding LV interpretation.}

[Poon11] said SPNs are mixtures models

Mixture models $\Rightarrow$ LV interpretation of SPNs

Normalized SPNs are equivalent to SPNs

Normalized SPNs + LV introduction $\Rightarrow$ completeness problem

New method fix with Pehartz solution
