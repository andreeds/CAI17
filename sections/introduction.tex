\section{Introduction}

[Background]\\
Two methods for augmenting SPNs.\\
Poupart and Pehartz.\\
Pehartz is better because it fixes the conflicting of indicator variables as LV with the completeness condition.\\
Also, Pehartz proposes a LV interpretation which allows to see augmented SPNs as BNs.\\
This resulted in a sound derivation of EM for SPNs.


[Problem] \\
The augmentation was proposed as a theoretical too to establish an work with the LV interpretation in SPNs
The augmented SPN can grow quadratically in $|S|$ for upper bound.

[New augmentation]
