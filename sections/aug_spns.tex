\section{On Augmentation of SPNs}

\cite{peharz2015theoretical} states that the BN representation by \cite{zhao2015relationship} can be recovered from the BN representation of augmented SPNs.
This tasks consists of constrain the twin-nodes to be equal to the sum-weights.
By changing the twin wights, all edges between latent variables are removed.



Peharz said: \\
Augmented SPN $\rightarrow$ Poupart BN

I say: \\
Normalized SPN $\rightarrow$ Peharz BN

Current Poupart:\\
	SPN $\rightarrow$ Normalized SPN $\rightarrow$ Poupart BN

We know:\\
	Augumented SPN $=$ Normalized SPN $+$ Twin Nodes
	

Introduce Twin Nodes in Normalized SPN

Poupart:\\
	SPN $\rightarrow$ Normalized SPN + Twin Nodes (Augmented SPN)$\rightarrow$ Poupart BN
	
Use Peharz method to:\\
	SPN $\rightarrow$ Augmented SPN $\rightarrow$ Pehartz BN
	
\subsection{Twin nodes alternative}

Instead of introducing twin nodes in Normalized SPN we can modify cope definition in normalized SPN.

The method consists in creating a storage for scope in the nodes.
in the Pehartz algorithm we would add the missing variables to the scope of some nodes.
